## 🌟 Key Features

### 🤖 AI-Powered PPH Risk Prediction

* **XGBoost-based model** trained on over 3,200 maternal records
* Predicts **Postpartum Hemorrhage (PPH)** risk from vital and obstetric parameters
* Provides **real-time risk prediction** and explainable feature contributions
* Generates downloadable **medical-grade reports**

### 🎙️ OT Mode – Voice-Activated Emergency Response

* Detects triple keyword **“blood, blood, blood”** to trigger emergency alert
* Instantly contacts **nearest blood bank** via Twilio integration
* Includes **visual confirmation**, **manual override**, and **activity logging**
* Designed as a **fallback system** during unpredictable hemorrhage emergencies

### 📊 Maternal Health Reporting

* Auto-generates detailed health summaries and risk reports
* PDF export for hospital documentation
* Tracks vitals: hemoglobin, platelets, blood pressure, BMI, and more

### 🏥 Blood Bank Management

* Real-time **inventory tracking** and **nearest bank locator**
* Automated **emergency request routing**
* Twilio-based **voice call system** for immediate response coordination

## 📋 How It Works

### PPH Risk Prediction Pipeline

```
Patient Data Input → Feature Engineering → XGBoost Model → Risk Score → Medical Report
```

**Input Parameters (15–18 Clinical Features):**
Maternal demographics, vital signs, obstetric history, delivery details, and risk factors including:

* Age, parity, BMI, hemoglobin, platelet count
* Previous PPH / C-section history
* Placenta previa/accreta, multiple pregnancy
* Gestational age, fetal weight, BP, heart rate
* Mode of delivery, induction, anesthesia type, retained placenta

**Output:**

* Risk category: Low / Medium / High
* Explainable feature importance
* Auto-generated medical report (PDF)
